This project is an exploit for a vulnerability found in McAfee Virus Scan Enterprise version 8.8.0.

This exploit can disable a password-protected instance of VSE so you can run malicious code without McAfee stopping you. The vulnerability actually lies within the McAfee Profiler application that is freely available on the internet.

In the future I may try to create a Metasploit module when I have time.

Enjoy!
